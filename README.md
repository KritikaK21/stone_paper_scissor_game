Usage: 
Setting up: Download or clone the repository to your computer.
Implementation: Navigate to the directory containing the game files.
Getting the Game Started: Use the following command to launch the stone_paper_scissors.py Python script: python stone_paper_scissors.py
Playing the game: The user is prompted to choose one of three options when the game launches: "stone," "paper," or "scissors."
By typing in their selection and hitting Enter, the user can input it.
A random selection is made by the computer from the options "stone," "paper," or "scissors."
Next, the game applies its rules to identify the winner:
Scissors versus stone (stone wins)
Cutting paper with scissors (scissors win)
Paper covers the stone. (paper wins)
If the player and the machine select the identical object, a tie results.
The user is shown the round's outcome (win, lose, or tie).
After every round, the score is tracked by the game and shown.
Repeat: Each round ends with an option for the user to continue playing or end it.
The game resets and a new round begins if the user chooses to play again.
The game ends and the user's final score is shown if they decide to stop.
In general, using the Stone Paper Scissors game on a computer means executing the Python script, entering options, and experiencing the results of the game. Users can play this easy-to-learn game on their terminal.
